Refactor your code to use components.

#### Setup

1. If you're not using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjwh472BRAGEiwAvHVfGlGs5LCRtT3uFIpRZ8A2rPZ_BxrTiEFfDSm21fn1EBKD0GkIHC3zThoC5mIQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), it's time to use it!
2. Download the [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) extension.
3. Go to your website (you might need to quit and open it again), open `Inspect` and make sure two tabs are added `components` and `profile`.

#### Home Component

1. Create a `components` folder inside `src`.
2. Create a new file and name it `Home.js`.
3. Create a function that represents your component.
4. Move the relevant JSX (website title, description and shop image) and all relevant code from `App.js` into the new component.
5. Export your component and import it in `App.js`.
6. Use the new component in `App.js`.
7. Check your website to make sure your code is correct, everything should look exactly the same.
8. Open the React Dev Tools and click on `component`. Your new component `Home` should be under `App`.

#### Product List Component

1. Create a new file and name it according to your shop's theme, make sure that the name starts with a capital letter. We'll call ours `ProductList`.

3. Move the relevant JSX and all relevant code from `App.js` into the new component.

3. Move the relevant JSX from the list component to the new component.
4. In your `ProductList` component, import your `ProductItem` component.
5. In the `map` method, render the `ProductItem` component and pass your product as a prop.
6. In your `ProductItem` component, pass `props` as your function's argument.
7. In your `products.js` file, add an `id` field to all your products.
